         <h2>What is the Universe</h2>
         <p>The universe is everything. It includes all of space, and all the matter and energy that space contains. It even includes time itself and, of course, it includes you.

Earth and the Moon are part of the universe, as are the other planets and their many dozens of moons. <br>
 Along with asteroids and comets, the planets orbit the Sun. <br>
The Sun is one among hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy, and most of those stars have their own planets, known as exoplanets.
</p>
<h2>Let's travel with space</h2>
<p>Space travel, or more specifically space tourism, is gaining traction as a travel option for those with the means. <br>
    While the cost is high, it's becoming increasingly accessible with companies like SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, and Blue Origin offering suborbital and orbital flights. <br>
    These trips offer unique experiences like seeing Earth from space, experiencing weightlessness, and potentially even contributing to scientific research. 
</p>
<h5>The solar system:</h5>
<p>The Solar System is a gravitationally bound system consisting of the Sun, eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune), their moons, dwarf planets (like Pluto), asteroids, comets, and other small bodies. <br>
    It formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of gas and dust. </p>
    <h5>Stars & galaxies:</h5>
    <p>Stars and galaxies are celestial objects found throughout the universe</p>
    <h5>Black holes:</h5>
    <p>Black holes are regions in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. </p>
    <h5>Astronaut life:</h5>
    <p>Astronauts living and working in space, particularly on the International Space Station (ISS), experience a unique and challenging environment. </p>
    <h2>Why Explore Space ?</h2>
    <p>Space exploration offers numerous benefits, from inspiring future generations to advancing technology and understanding our place in the universe. <br>
        It provides a new perspective on Earth, allows us to study the solar system, and can lead to technological breakthroughs that improve daily life. <br>
        Space exploration also has the potential to address global challenges and ensure the long-term survival of humanity. </p>
